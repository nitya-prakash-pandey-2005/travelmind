# TravelMind

AI copilot for travel agencies and corporate travel: quotes from live supplier inventory,
every price verified against real offers, fare intelligence, policy and approvals.

> Status: Milestone 1 in progress. Plan 1 (backend foundation) is complete.
> `frontend/` is the legacy prototype UI and is replaced in M1 Plan 4.

## Layout

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `backend/` | FastAPI app (`src/travelmind`), Alembic migrations, tests |
| `infra/postgres/init.sql` | Creates DB roles (`travelmind_owner`, `travelmind_app`) and databases |
| `docker-compose.yml` | Postgres 16 + pgvector (port 5433), Redis 7 (port 6380) |
| `docs/superpowers/specs/` | Product/architecture spec |
| `docs/superpowers/plans/` | Implementation plans |

## Run locally

Prerequisites: Docker Desktop, [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

```bash
docker compose up -d --wait
cd backend
cp .env.example .env
uv sync
uv run python -m alembic upgrade head
uv run python -m travelmind.reference.cli import-ourairports
uv run uvicorn travelmind.main:create_app --factory --reload
```

API docs: http://localhost:8000/docs

## Test

```bash
cd backend
uv run pytest            # needs docker compose services running
uv run ruff check . && uv run mypy src
```

Reset the local database completely: `docker compose down -v && docker compose up -d --wait`.

## Security model (short)

- Tenant data tables use Postgres row-level security (forced); the app connects as a role
  that cannot bypass it. Identity tables are only accessed through `travelmind.identity`.
- Sessions are opaque, revocable, httpOnly cookies; passwords use Argon2.
- Cross-site state-changing requests are rejected; login is rate limited.
